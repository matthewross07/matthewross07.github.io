####I use ideas from geomorphology, hydrology, and
####ecology to understand how humans [alter ecosystems](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-environ-121012-100957).
####As a PhD student at Duke University, I worked with my advisers
####[Emily Bernhardt](http://bernhardtlab.weebly.com/), [Martin Doyle](http://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/martindoyle/), and [Brian McGlynn](http://www.mcglynnlab.com/)
#### to understand how mountaintop mining for coal
#### has changed the [physical landscape](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.5b04532) in Central Appalachia
#### and how these changes lead to long-term and dramatic 
#### shifts in hydrologic and biogeochemical regimes and changes
#### in local and regional water quality. As a post-doctoral researcher
#### at UNC Chapel Hill, I'm working with Tamlin Pavelsky on
#### multi- and hyper- spectral remote sensing techniques
#### to understand water quality changes at regional to global scales
