First to pique your interest in the content of the course through open discussion and sharing some videos and images. Second, to get to know each other both in terms of your academic background and your interest in Water Quality. 3.1 Land-Use change A core component of this class will be understanding how people change the landscape and how these changes propagate downstream. There are many ways people can impact the land and satellites have been recording these changeas since the 1970s, and with high resolution since 1984, with the launch of Landsat 5. What kind of land-use change can you see in the video below? What human impacts are not captured by this video or by satellite observation in general? Which land-use changes are most likely to impact inland waters? If you enjoy looking at these timelapses, I encourage you to play around with this website from Google and Carnegie Melon which shows the entire globe changing over the past 30 years. 3.2 Types of Water Quality Change The ways people can alter water quality are almost limitless as we continue to invent new chemicals, create novel cocktails of elements, and a myriad other impacts. Understanding which of these impacts are most harmful to people and the environment will be part of this course, but we will also cover which problems are avoidable, which are inherent to modern life, and which ones can be treated. What water quality problem do you think is most pressing right now in Colorado? in the United States? the Globe? What causes the water quality problem you identifed from above? Was it land-use change or something else? 3.3 My work on land-use change - Mining in West Virginia For my PhD I worked on understanding the impacts of a particularly destructive form of coal mining called Mounataintop Mining. Mountaintop mining covers almost 6,000 square kilometers of land in Central Appalachia. This map shows the expansion of Mountaintop Mining in West Virginia and Kentucky. You can see more here Unlike most land-use change impacts, mounataintop mining does not only change the land in two-dimensions, but direclty alters the topography of the landscape as shown here. Whether agricutlure, mining, or industry, almost all human activities on land end up impacting water quality downstream. 3.4 Types of Water Quality Change What water quality problem do you think is most pressing right now in Colorado? in the United States? the Globe? What causes the water quality problem you identifed from above? Was it land-use change or something else? 3.5 Examples of water quality impacts For each image answer the following questions what is the water quality impact you see? What may have caused this impact? Is it natural or human-caused? 3.5.1 Lake Erie Lake Erie algae bloom caused by excess nutrients from agriculture and increasing temperatures from climate change 3.5.2 Animas Animas river had ~ 3 million gallons of mine waste accidentally released into it from the abandoned Gold King Mine. The spill contained a variety of elemental contaminants including: arsenic, cadmium, lead, aluminum, and copper, with the orange color coming from iron. The long-term impacts from the spill are still unknown 3.5.3 West Virginia This is a case where the murky brown water you see in this flood are completely natural. This was a major flooding event in a reference watershed for some of our work on the impacts of mining (more here). This was just a very large flood that mobilized a lot of sediment in the river. I’m standing on a bridge that is about 4 feet above the river bottom. 3.5.4 West Virginia 2 In this image we have Laurel Branch flowing into the Mud River. Although the Mud River water looks clear here, both streams are heavily impacted by mining and have high ion concentrations in the water leading to elevated salinity and declines in biodiversity. Not all pollutants are visible. 3.5.5 Fort Collins Video documenting a fish kill that happened in Fort Collins in October of 2018. The cause of the fish kill is still unkown, but something the city is still investigating. These kinds of events often cause lots of public attention but understanding exactly why fish-kills occur can be difficult. 3.5.6 Boulder Starting in 2004, David Norris noticed that the fish in Boulder Creek were changing sex. Eventually he discovered that this was due to a suite of chemicals that imitate estrogen being released into the river. Modern organic contaminants are one of the least well-understood impacts to water quality. 3.6 Treatment As we will learn in this class most water quality problems are pernicious and wicked Difficult to treat once they start and hard to disentangle from the land-use change that causes them 3.7 Summary The goal of this course is for you to intuitively and quantitatively understand the linkages between human’s actions on land and our downstream water quality impacts.

["watersheds-and-hydrographs.html", "5 Watersheds and Hydrographs 5.1 Watersheds and human impacts. 5.2 Hydrographs", " 5 Watersheds and Hydrographs Understanding what is in water, how it got there, and if we can do anything about it requires, at a minimum, first understanding where the water came from. In rivers and/or lakes, the first step towards this deceptively difficult task is finding the boundaries within which water drains to a specifc point. The ‘watershed boundary’ theoretically (actual water flow is complicated) indicates a separation between where a rain drop will flow if it lands on one side of the boundary or the other. Everything inside a single watershed boundary is called a ‘catchment area’, ‘catchment’, or in the USA a ‘watershed.’ Inisde a single watershed, as water flows downhill from rainfall or snowmelt it will accumulate the hydrologic and chemical signals from all the geologic features (bedrock geochemistry), ecological features (wetland dissolved carbon), and human impacts. The simple video below does a pretty good job making these ideas more clear. 5.1 Watersheds and human impacts. Generally, the more human activities in a watershed, the more likely there is to be both hydrologic and water quality impacts downstream. Looking at the three watersheds highlighted below (generated from the amazing stream stats). Which of the three is most likely to have water quality impacts? What kind of water quality impacts might that (or those) have? You can change the basemape by clicking on the stacked layer icon in the top left. Thinking about how watersheds aggregate human impacts will be core to this class, along with a basic understanding of how water moves through these watersheds. 5.2 Hydrographs The main way hydrologists, biogeochemists, ecologists, and anyone else working with river data thinks about the total amount of water draining out of a watershed, is by looking at hydrographs. Hydrographs represent the volume of water moving past a specific point over a given period, which could be a single storm event, water year, or over decades. Hydrographs can tell us how water is moving through a hydrologic system, is most of the water coming out right after a rain storm (a ‘flashy’ hydrograph), or is something in the system slowing the water down and rainfall does not get rapidly converted to rainfall, but instead comes out mostly as baseflow (water leaving the system between storm or snowmelt events). Looking at the graph below: Which site has a more baseflow dominated hydrograph? What might be impacting the hydrographs you see? In the above graph, Watershed1 is on the Verdigris River in Oklahoma, but so is Watershed2. The difference in flow patterns between the two is that Watershed2 is downstream of Oologah Lake, which was made by a large dam on the Verdigris River. In the hydrograph you can see the delayed delivery of water from the upstream portion of Watershed1 to the downstream station at Watershed2. The way water moves through a landscape is an important control on what the water picks up as it flows over, through, and under the landscape. Further, different water quality constituents will respond differently to changes in hydrology. Three possible water quality responses are shown below. In future lessons we will dive deeper into what water quality constituents exhibit these responses to changes in discharge. For now, it is most important to understand that water quality constituents can depend heavily on changes in discharge by either decreasing in concentration with more water (Dilution), increasing in concentration with more water (Enrichment). Some constituents are not responsive to changes in discharge and we call those Chemostatic. "],
["watershed-ecosystem-approach.html", "6 Watershed-Ecosystem Approach 6.1 Ecosystems as watersheds", " 6 Watershed-Ecosystem Approach A modern approach to understanding water quality change in rivers and lakes involves integrating ideas from both hydrology and ecology, particularly the watershed (catchment, I use these interchangeably) and ecosystem concepts. Both of these ideas are relatively new and their integrated study has only happened for the last fifty years. 6.0.1 Modern watershed studies While there is ample evidence that some understanding of watershed ideas were present in deeper history (a great book on this is A Forest on The Sea). Modern watershed studies only began in the late 1800s and early 1900s, with the first recorded study as presented by McCulloch and Robinson (1993) in Switzerland. This study compared hydrologic response between a forested catchment and a pasture, showing forested catchments had lower erosion, flood flows, and annual water yields, with higher baseflows (MuCulloch &amp; Robinson, 1993). These kind of paired catchment studies were replicated throughout the United States shortly after the Swiss experiment with important studies in Wagon Wheel Gap in 1910. The approach in the United States copied the Swiss approach in many ways, but many watershed studies were truly experimental in nature, where forested catchments were instrumented before deforestation. The researchers would collect some data (discharge, precip, etc…) before deforestation and compare watershed response both before and after cutting and compared to an uncut forest. This experimental approach became the gold-standard for watershed studies and is still commonly used today. 6.0.2 Ecosystems Shortly after many of these initial watershed studies, another important idea in environmental sciences was invented. Before 1935, the term ecosystem did not exist, and ecologist’s were in a long-lasting heated debate about how plant communities changed over time, mostly in the absence of our current understnading of ecosystems as the integrated biotic and abiotic systems we think of today. In a stunningly readable and clear argument, Sir Arthur Tansley argues that we can’t understand plant community change without the ecosystem concept. In the article- The Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts and Terms- defines an ecosystem as: \" These ecosystems, as we may call them , are of the most various kinds and sizes. They form one category of the multitudinous physical systems of the universe, which range from the universe as a whole down to the atom.\" This now deeply familiar idea changed the field of ecology, and, when linked with the watershed concept is one of the most important approaches we use to understand changes in water quality. 6.1 Ecosystems as watersheds Early forest watershed research in the 1900s fundamentally changed the way we manage forests for both sustained biomass and reduced erosion, increased water quality. After 1935, ecosystem ideas fundamentally changed the way we think about environmental systems. However it wasn’t until the 1960s that these ideas were explitly linked, changing the way we think about what stream chemistry can tell us about land-use impacts on water quality and ecosystem processes. In their paper Nutrient cycling, F.H. Bormann and G. E. Likens lay out a compelling argument for using small watersheds as one physically bounded example of Tansley’s ecosystem concept. This paper is clear and relatively easy to understand and rather than re-writing their ideas, you should just read it here: Bormann and Likens, 1967. "],
["nutrients.html", "7 Nutrients 7.1 What is a nutrient? 7.2 Interacting nutrient cycles 7.3 The Nitrogen and Phosphorus cycles 7.4 Excess nutrients cause water quality problems. 7.5 Modern nutrient water quality problems 7.6 Redox", " 7 Nutrients 7.1 What is a nutrient? Nutrients are the substances that help life survive, grow, and reproduce. These can be complex carbohydrates used for energy like starches or amino acids used to build proteins, or we can think of nutrients as the elements that make these complex life-building blocks. Frequently when talking about life, we focus on a group of elements that are most common in almost all biologically relevant molecules. This group is called CHNOPS for Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur. Together these elements make up 98% of living tissues. The video below does a good job explaining why these elements (and many others) are vital to life: The elements vital to life are constantly cycling in and out of life forms and into abiotic forms. The carbon molecules in a peach are converted to CO\\(_2\\) when we eat the peach, break it down into it’s component parts, and respire the sugar, using the energy to maintain ourselves. The movement of this carbon molecule into our bodies, and then into the atmosphere, and, eventually, back into another plant is called a biogeochemical cycle. A full discusiong of biogeochemical cycling is beyond the scope of this course but this is a great book if you are interested. Instead, we will focus on a subset of biogeochmical cycles called nutrient cycles, in particular the Nitrogen and Phosphorus cycles, which have a heavy influence on water quality. 7.2 Interacting nutrient cycles 7.2.1 Liebig’s law of the minimum Nutrient cycles interact in a variety of ways, but some of our earliest concepts of how nutrient cycles depend on each other was from ideas from agriculture. One such concept is called \"Liebig’s law of the minimum which states that plants grow not in response to the total amount of resources they have (water, nutrients, light, etc…) but in proportion to the most scarce resource (the limiting nutrient). So if a plant has all the N it needs but not enough P it will only grow to the point where it runs out of P. While we have a more rich understanding of coupled nutrient cycling, this concept is still a useful way for starting to think about how one nutrient can impact others. 7.2.2 Redfield ratio Another critical way we understand nutrient cycling is by understanding ecological stoichiometry, which is the study of how lifeforms require elements in certain ratios and how they change in order to meet these requirements. The idea that lifeforms have specific ratios of elements they need to maintain comes from early research by Alfred C. Redfield in 1934. Through oceanic surveys of C, N, and P content in marine biomass Redfield found that there was a consistent ratio of these elements to each other, across the world’s oceans. We now call this ratio the redfield ratio which as originally stated was 106 C:16 N:1 P. Where there is 106 moles of carbon, for every 16 moles of Nitrogen, for every 1 mol of Phosphorus in the biomass of marine life. This ratio varies across different lifeforms, but it is another way of thinking about how nutrient cycles might interact. 7.3 The Nitrogen and Phosphorus cycles Nitrogen and Phosphorus are vital elements for life and their biogeochemical cycles have been heavily altered by people, with severe consequences for water quality. 7.4 Excess nutrients cause water quality problems. In order to sustain the world’s growing population, we need to consistently supply nutrients to our croplands so that our crops can grow. Before 1900, most of this fertilizer was simply animal waste or manure direclty applied to land. With limited supplies of manure, there was a limited apacity for agriculture to maximize yields on croplands. Until the Haber-Bosch process was invented, which dramatically increased our capacity to deliver Nitrogen compounds directly to plants for croplands. 7.4.1 Haber-Bosch The Haber-Bosch process coupled with the globalized mining of Phosphorus has made it so that in many parts of the world these nutrients no longer limit plant growth. 7.4.2 Phosphate mining 7.4.3 Excess nutrients The readily available N and P generated from Haber-Bosch and global phosphate mining has helped feed a growing global population, but frequently fertilizers end up running off into adjacent water bodies. Causing algae blooms and subsequent eutrophication in lakes, estuaries, and the near-coast environment. 7.5 Modern nutrient water quality problems The problem of excess nutrients in freshwaters is a global problem that exists in almost every nation. Lots of modern research efforts are aimed at assessing the extent of excess nutrients in the world’s rivers, lakes, and coastal margins. Some of my favorite papers or summaries of papers on the subject are here: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6155/205 http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/427 https://www.jstor.org/stable/1743244?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents And many many more. 7.6 Redox For biogeochemical cycles generally, and for nutrient cycling especially, redox reactions are the chemical reactions that govern the transformations, transport, control, and impact of nutrients on waters.

["redox-biogeochemistry.html", "8 Redox biogeochemistry 8.1 Redox review 8.2 Oxidative state (or oxidation number) rules", " 8 Redox biogeochemistry 8.1 Redox review Redox is portmanteau of the words Reduction-oxidation and refers to chemical reactions where electrons ‘move’ from one atom to the other (it’s actually more complicated, but this idea works for our purposes). The video below shows one redox reaction showing the oxidation of elemental iron which has the net equation: \\(4Fe_{(s)} + 3O_2 -&gt; 2Fe_2O_{3(s)}\\) The sparks in the video come from the movement of electrons in elemental Fe moving to oxygen, giving off heat (sparks). The below video provides a nice review of redox chemistry ideas: 8.1.1 Redox reactions sustains life The movement of electrons from one elemental bond to another, release energy that lifeforms can use to maintain themselves. The amount of energy that a lifeform gets out of a reaction largely depends on the final electron acceptor or the element that is reduced by a redox reaction. For most advanced lifeforms, this element is oxygen, which is one of the most energy efficient final electron acceptors. But there are many other potential final electron acceptors that microbes can use as final electron accepters (\\(NO_3, SO_4^{2-}, CO_2\\) and more). These non-oxygen redox reactions can have serious implications for nutrient and biogeochemical cycling in waterbodies, and can be intentionally manipulated to control water quality. 8.1.2 Rules of redox To understand how redox is important in water quality we first need to do a quick review of redox chemistry. Reduction/oxidation reactions Electrons are exchanged from one atom to another Atoms that gain electrons are called reduced Atoms that lose electrons are called oxidized Oxidation Is Loss Reduction Is Gain of electrons (OIL-RIG) 8.1.3 Breaking down a redox reaction There are systematic ways to know which elements gain or lose electrons in a given chemical reaction. One important way to keep track of electrons in a reaction is by accounting for the oxidation number of elements throughout a reaction. The oxidation number is a way of conceptualizing which atom has extra electrons (more negative) versus which ones have lost some electrons (more positive). With these rules we can break down the equation above into the elements that gain and lose electrons, without knowing anything else about the reaction. \\(4Fe_{(s)} + 3O_2 -&gt; 2Fe_2O_{3(s)}\\) 8.2 Oxidative state (or oxidation number) rules 8.2.0.1 Rule 1 If single element (or self-bonded element)-oxidation number of 0 O\\(_2\\), H\\(_2\\), Al, Ag, Hg, Fl\\(_2\\) - all have oxidation number of 0 8.2.0.2 Rule 2 Monatomic ions have oxidation number of their charge Na\\(^+\\) = +1, Cl\\(^-\\) = -1 8.2.0.3 Rule 3 Alkali metals (far left of periodic table) = +1 oxidation number &lt;img src=’https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/12031026/Periodic_table-group1.jpg width=70%&gt; The alkali metals have an oxidation number of +1 which means they frequently are in reactions where they give away an electron, which releases heat. As you go down the periodic table in the Alkali column, these reactions get more and more energetic as shown in the video below: 8.2.0.4 Rule 4 Alkaline metals (second from left on periodic table) have oxidation number of +2 8.2.0.5 Rule 5 Hydrogen is +1 when bonded to a non-metal Hydrogen is -1 when bonded to a metal 8.2.0.6 Rule 6 Oxygen is almost always -2 Unless it is in a peroxide it is -1 (H\\(_2\\)O\\(_2\\)) 8.2.0.7 Rule 7 Fluorine is always -1 along with other halogens 8.2.0.8 Rule 8 Sum of oxidation numbers in a molecule is zero or the charge of the molecule. NaCl = 0, SO\\(_4^{2-}\\) = -2 8.2.1 Assigning oxidation number You can apply the above rules to figure out the oxidation number of most chemicals. NO\\(_3^-\\) Here we don’t know anything about N oxidation number so we first apply the rule for oxygen (-2*3 molecules = -6) and then we see that the total charge is -1 so the molecule oxidation number =-1, with these two pieces of information we know that the oxidation number for N is equal to:-6 + N = -1 or N = +5. CaCO\\(_3\\) Here we don’t know the oxidation number for C, so we again apply the rules we do no and then we can figure out the oxidation number for C. First Ca is an alkaline metal so it’s oxidation number is 2. Again oxygen is -2 (-2*3 = -6) so that leaves us with the equation: -6 + 2 + C = 0 where the oxidation number of C = +4. 8.2.2 Why do we care about oxidation number? The reactions that maintain life depend on electron exchange Chemical reactions need to be balanced by mass (moles of chemicals) But also by electrons Understanding element, pollutant, and nutrient transformations requires knowing redox chemistry 8.2.3 Redox in the environment Because different redox reactions yield different amounts of energy for lifeforms, there is essentially a redox economy where the microbes using the most efficient electron acceptor available will win out and ultimately survive. To understand this idea of different energy yields for different reactions, we need to review another chemistry concept called Gibbs Free energy. "],
["gibbs-free-energy-in-aquatic-environments.html", "9 Gibbs free energy in aquatic environments 9.1 Energy in chemical reactions 9.2 Non-standard \\(\\Delta G\\) yield 9.3 Redox ladder 9.4 Redox potential 9.5 Redox and nutrients", " 9 Gibbs free energy in aquatic environments 9.1 Energy in chemical reactions As previously described, redox reactions power life by releasing energy when electrons move from one compound or element to another. These reactions can yield different amounts of energy to the lifeform depending on the reagents involved. The total energy yield of a reaction is captured by the concept of Gibbs free energy \\(\\Delta G\\). You may have come across the idea of Gibbs free energy when thinking about whether or not a reaction will proceed spontaneously where: \\(\\Delta\\)G &lt; 0 will be a spontaneous reaction \\(\\Delta\\)G &gt; 0 will be non-spontaneous (requires energy input). And for a general review of Gibbs free energy you can go here. And watch the video below that explains energy yield in the context of electrochemistry (batteries) But we are really focused on the Gibbs free energy yield in living systems. 9.1.1 Standard Gibbs free energy Over decades scientists have figured out the standard gibbs free energy of formation for a very long list of elements and compounds. We can use these free energy estimates of compounds to estimate the total energy yield of a reaction using the following equation: \\(G^o = {\\sum}\\Delta G_{products} - {\\sum}\\Delta G_{reactants}\\) Where \\(G^o\\) is the standard free energy yield of a reaction at \\(25^o\\) and 1 atmosphere pressure with 1 mole of that substance. We can use the above equation to estimate how much energy a microbe may get out of a reaction. For example the reaction: \\(3NO_{(g)} -&gt; N_2O_{(g)} + NO_{2(g)}\\) with \\(\\Delta G_f^o\\) (standard gibbs free energy of formation values of): \\(NO_{(g)}\\) = 86.55 kJ/mol \\(N_2O_{(g)}\\) = 104.18 kJ/mol \\(NO_{2(g)}\\) = 51.29 kJ/mol Plugging these numbers into the equation we get \\(\\Delta G^o = (1 * 104.18 kJ/mol + 1 * 51.29 kJ/mol) - (3 * 86.55)\\) \\(\\Delta G^o = -104.18 kJ\\) Knowing that final standard free energy yield gives us a sense of how much energy a lifeform can get out of a redox reaction. But these numbers are at standard state. What about non-standard temperatures or concentrations? 9.2 Non-standard \\(\\Delta G\\) yield The above equation gives the standard free energy yield with 1 mole of each reactant at \\(25^o\\)C and 1 atmosphere pressure. Of course, almost all reactions in nature will not be at standard conditions like these. To calculate this “actual” Gibbs free energy in the environment we need to use one last equation. If we had the generic chemical reaction: \\(aA+bB = cC+dD\\) Then we would estimate the actual gibbs free energy yield of a reaction as: \\(\\Delta G = \\Delta G^o + RT ln\\left(\\frac{([C]^c*[D]^d)}{([A]^a*[B]^b)}\\right)\\) Where \\(\\Delta G^o\\) is the standard free energy yield of a reaction (calculated above), R is the universal gas constant \\(R = 0.008314 \\frac{kJ}{mol K}\\) and K is temperature in Kelvin \\(K= Temp^oC + 273.15\\) 9.3 Redox ladder Knowing the \\(Delta G\\) of a reaction can tell us which microbes are likely to be active under different environmental conditions. This is because microbes can use a variety of compounds as so-called “final electron acceptors.” Depending on the final electron acceptor used by microbes the metabolism of energy bearing compounds like sugar or acetic acid will generate different amounts of energy. The microbes using the most energy-efficient pathway (i.e. the most negative \\(Delta G\\)) will “win” and likely that reaction will be dominant in those environmental conditions. The most efficient final electron acceptor is oxygen, but there are a large variety of other final electron acceptors with varying energy yields. To capture these complex ideas of energy yield, biogeochemists use a term called the “redox ladder.” This term indicates the declining energy yield as microbial communities switch final electron acceptors. The above image is from this very thorough website at ESF which you can use for additional review. As microbial communities descend down the redox ladder, there is increasingly less free energy produced. The order of electron acceptors from most energy to least energy is: oxygen, then nitrate, then manganese (not shown above), then iron, then sulfate, and finally, carbon dioxide. The redox ladder is mostly a conceptual idea of how microbial communities are organized by redox reactions and energy yields, but frequently the redox ladder is mapped directly onto physical space. For example, near the sediment surface of a shallow pond, there is oxygen exchange with the water column and oxygen is available as the most efficient final elecron acceptor. But as you go deeper into the sediment, the oxygen is consumed by microbes closer to the surface, and thre is eventually so little that it is more efficient to use nitrate (\\(NO_3^-\\)) as a final electron acceptor. Going even deeper the microbes run out of nitrate and switch to iron reduction, and so on. A good example of how the redox ladder maps to physical space is called a Winogradsky column 9.4 Redox potential The redox ladder is one way of capturing the reactions that are likely to occur, but there are two other ways. First is to simpley describe the environment as oxygen-rich or not. An oxic environment is likely to have oxygen as the final electron acceptor, suboxic environments can have a mix of oxygen and other final electron acceptors, while microbes in anoxic (no oxygen) environments will rely on non-oxygen electron acceptors (like \\(NO_3^-\\)). Another, more quantitative way to describe the redox environment of natural waters (like lakes or ponds) sediments, or aquifers is to directly measure the reduction potential in the environment. This \\(E_h\\) scale goes from -1 to 1 with 1 representing oxic environments where reduction is likely to occur and -1 representing reduced environments with limited potential for reduction. This excellent paper (by a CSU professor, Thomas Borch) provides a clear explanation of how reduction potential and redox more generally control reactions that govern water quality, with a key figure below: It’s beyond the scope of this course (at present) to deeply define the reduction potential scale but wikipedia does a pretty good job if you are curious. 9.5 Redox and nutrients The paper above by Borch and others outlines a variety of ways that redox conditions control water quality, but I wanted to highlight specifically two ways that redox conditions control nutrient concentrations in inland waters. 9.5.1 Nitrogen cycling and redox First, as highlighted previously the nitrogen cycle includes a critical step where biologically-available nitrogen in the form of \\(NO_3^-\\) or \\(NH_3\\) is eventually converted to biologically inert \\(N_2\\). This removal of nitrogen from inland waters is a critical way that we can reduce nutrient pollution in lakes, rivers, and the near-coastal environment. For the denitrification to occur, microbes need anoxic conditions so that \\(NO_3^-\\) reduction (denitrification) is the most efficient final electron acceptor. But, in order to remove all of the \\(NH_3\\) from the system as well, a nitrification step must first occur where \\(NH_3\\) is converted to \\(NO_3^-\\). This process where \\(NH_3\\) is used as electron donor (energy source) requires oxygen, so full removal of nitrogen from inland waters requires both oxic and anoxic conditions. These processes (with a more advanced picture of the redox reactions involved) are captured in the figure below from this very helpful explaner on the Nitrogen cycle. 9.5.2 Phosphorus Unlike the nitrogen cycle, Phosphorus has no gaseous phase on earth, so removing it from inland waters either requires it to be taken up by plants or other lifeforms or for it to be bound up by other minerals. In many lakes, the most common form of P binding is when \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) with it’s charge of -3 binds up with aqueous iron (\\(Fe^{3+}\\)). This effectively removes the Phosphorus from the water column and makes it inaccessible to algae. However, once the \\(FePO_4\\) sinks to the bottom of a lake or wetland, the iron can be reduced to \\(Fe^{2+}\\) and the phosphate will then desorb from the iron, being released into the environment as bioavailable P. As a result, Phosphorus dynamics in inland waters are deeply dependent on redox reactions and conditions. Redox conditions are some of the ultimate controls on nutrient cycling, but what happens when excess nutrients reach the coast or lakes? Frequently, it causes harmful algal blooms. "],
["harmful-algal-blooms.html", "10 Harmful Algal Blooms 10.1 Alternative stable states", " 10 Harmful Algal Blooms Algae blooms can be a natural process that occurs in lakes, rivers, and estuaries, when conditions are just right (temperature, nutrients, etc…). But these blooms can become harmful to people when so much algae grows that when it dies, algal decomposition removes all the oxygen from the water column. Another kind of harmful algal bloom can occur when certain species of cyanobacteria, that produce toxins grow rapidly. Human activities (increasing temperatures, excess nutrients) have increased the likelihood and extent of many algae blooms. The video below highlights the key drivers of these blooms. 10.1 Alternative stable states One important idea that lake ecologists have discovered in the past 30 years is that lakes are susceptible to sudden shifts in ecological status. With regards to harmful algal blooms specifically, this essentially means that nutrients can be added for years to a lake with no visible sign of a transition to a more eutrophic, algal bloom dominated state. Then, all of a sudden the lake can switch into an algal dominated state. The key idea with alternative stable states in lakes is that simply removing the same amount of nutrients from the system that were originally added, will not return the lake to a lower algae state. This idea has been written about 1000s of times, but a great paper from 1993 by Scheffer and others is really well-written and clear.

Chemical weathering happens when water, filled with organic, carbonic, and other acids, reaches bedrock, which it slowly dissolves. Humans have profoundly altered weathering rates across the world, by increasing the amount of acidity in rain, streamwater, and from mining. Increasing chemical weathering rates mobilizes more cations and anions along with other metals and trace elements, increasing their concentrations in freshwaters. As with previous lessons, the folks at Crash Course have built a series of videos that provide an excellent review of the key chemistry ideas that govern chemical weathering rates and how humans have altered these rates. 11.1 Acid rain One of the most profound and widespread impacts people have had on chemical weathering rates is by increasing the acidity of rain. Essentially, combustion of coal and other fossil fuels, releases \\(NO_x\\) and \\(SO_x\\) compounds, which interact with water vapor to form the strong acids: nitric and sulfuric acid. Higher acidity from these compounds leads to higher weathering rates (or in the case of the video, higher statue-melting rates). 11.1.1 pH review One critical idea when working in acid-base chemistry is the idea of a pH scale (and it’s inverse the pOH scale). The video below explains this idea quite clearly. 11.2 Buffers One way to lessen the impact of adding a strong acid or base to a solution is to buffer the system with weak acid and bases. The nuts and bolts of buffered solutions is explained in the below video. 11.3 The carbonate equilibrium buffer In natural waters the most important buffer is the carbonate equilibrium system whereby \\(CO_2\\) dissolves into solution forming both \\(HCO_3^-\\) and \\(H_2CO_3\\). Excess \\(HCO_3^-\\) in natural waters acts as a natural buffer, limiting the impact of additonal acids being added to the system. Other buffers exisit in natural systems and the sum of their ability to absorb incoming acids is called: Alkalinity. This paper by Stephen Lower goes into much more detail about the carbonate equilibrium system, alkalinity, and natural waters. You should review this in addition to watching the above videos. 11.4 Acid-mine drainage Acid-mine drainage is a human-induced change to natural waters that can completely override any alkalinity in the system and dramatically reduce the pH to ~ 1 or 2. The primary culprit contributing all this extra acidity is pyrite (\\(FeS_2\\)). When mining operations unearth bedrock to access gold, coal, copper, or other resources, this bedrock is often enriched in pyrite or other sulfur bearing compounds. When these compounds are exposed to air and water the sulfur dissolves and oxidizes forming \\(H_2SO_4\\) a strong acid. Because mining operations frequently concentrate the overburden (the excess rock generated by mining), there is often large volumes of pyrite in a relatively small areas. All this excess acidity, increases weathering rates, and dissolving a suite of metals that are toxic to people and biota, in addition to the direct problems from low pH. Acid-mine drainage is a problem for both new and old mines and it can be a problem that lasts for decades or centuries. This paper provides an excellent overview of how Acid-Mine Drainage problems occur and some approaches people have used to address them. 11.5 Additional human impacts to weathering rates Lowering the acidity of rain and streams may be the most important ways in which humans have altered weathering rates, releasing metals and other trace elements into freshwaters. However, weathering rates are not only controlled by acidity. Chemical weathering rates increase with a number of other variables including: Increasing temperatures (because of reaction kinetics) Increasing reactive surface area of bedrock (more reaction sites) Increasing water flux (more constantly refreshed reaction interface) Humans are actively increasing all of these controls on weathering through climate change (increased temperature, increased rainfall in some areas), increasing surface area of bedrock (construction, earth-moving, surface mining), and increasing water flux through ecosystems (agricultural irrigation, lawn irrigiation). Increasing weathering rates can increase the salinity of freshwaters, increase the alkalinity in rivers, and increase trace element concentration in rivers The net result of all these alterations to weathering processes and rates, plus a variety of other human impacts on freshwaters are creating novel chemical cocktails in freshwaters throughout the world. The impacts of novel combinations of elements on aquatic life and people are poorly understood. "]
