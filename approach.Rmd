####I like to work on broad theoretical ideas paired
####with analysis and visualization of water data from 
#### *in situ* sensors at field sites and larger 
####publically available spatiotemporal datasets.
####Mostly this means I spend a lot of time 
####programming in R. In fact this whole website 
####was made using RMarkdown. For examples of my work
####you can go to my [github](https://github.com/matthewross07), scroll down here
####or look at my ShinyR data applications:

####-[Mining has dramatically changed the landscape in West Virginia](http://mtm-explore.web.duke.edu/)
####-[Mining changes how water moves through mined landscapes and water quality](http://mtm-hydro.web.duke.edu/)
####-[Mining increases weathering rates of bedrock](http://mtm-weathering.web.duke.edu/)
####-[60 year record of watershed biogeochemistry at Hubbard Brook, in progress](http://hbef.streampulse.org/)
####- [Introductory environmental science course material](http://env102.web.duke.edu/)
####- [Looking at changes in watershed chemistry in the Blue River Watershed, CO](http://bluewatershed.web.duke.edu/)
