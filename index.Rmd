####Building cities, farming crops, and mining ore all have changed
####the face of the earth. In many of these altered places, 
####human design decisions control environmental processes 
####more than the co-evolution of landform and ecosystem.
####I study these human landscapes by asking:

####**1) How do these designed ecosystems work?**

####**2) What feedbacks are most important in structuring these places?**

####**3) Can we use knowledge from 1&2 to design ecosystems better?**
