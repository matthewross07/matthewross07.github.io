Come to Fort Collins and help me get my lab started! 

I am recruiting a PhD student for fall of 2019. For now, the exact nature of the project is open, though it will likely be focused on using large open-access datasets to interrogate how people are changing the environment, especially freshwaters. I'm especially looking to work with someone interested in developing a strong background in both ecosystem ecology and data science with an eye towards using this knowledge to move the needle on how we design, restore, and/or conserve ecosystems. Ideally, this student would have a master's or previous work experience in data science and/or ecosystem ecology. 

Some ideas for what this might look like are on my [research](research.html) page, but I'm open to other kinds of work. 

If you are interested, please contact me at mrvr(at)rams.colostate.edu
